# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer:
  The relavance of `this` is apparent in the Javacript method of "class." You would use "this" when refering to something you want to add a value to in your class. example: this.gas = 10.

  Researched answer:
  "this" is in refrence to an "object" in the class method in javascript, and as per usual, I  was only half right above, an object is the cross of data and function so it gains a value and a function.


2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer:
  This I feel like I can confidently answer without much research. React is a mulitfacited open-source tool you can use to build user interfaces such as webpages and apps. It can be used to build decadent websites like "Netflix" and detailed apps like facebook and twitter. I would use React because it is one of the leading industry tools in app developement today and once you get used to the JSX language, it can be pretty straight forward to use (realize I did not say easy).  

  Researched answer:
  React is a open-source JavaScript "library" used for creating web pages, apps or just UI in general that they state is "painless" to create... I suppose it depends on who you ask. React uses a virtual DOM to keep refreshing at an all time low. Instead React allows for users to interact with individual nodes that refresh when interacted with. React was released to the public less than a decade ago by the "Facebook and community" group. 



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer:
  The lifecycle method that is required to use in a React class component is "State".

  Researched answer:
The constructor is the method required for a react class component. 


4. What is JSX? What is one notable difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer:
  I can only recall from memory what Sarah said which is " JSX is Reacts marraige of Javascript and HTML." It has most of the functionality of Html with some Javascript capabilities. I'm not 100% on the diffrences, but I know there are limitations on how you write JavaScript into the return, for example, you need curly braces around your functions.
  
  Researched answer:
  One larger difference between HTML and JSX is that JSX uses className instead of class, because class is already used by javaScript. Also, JSX can only render a single component. 



5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer:
  When you run yarn in your react, there is a large file called "node-modules" and "yarn.lock" that are nested right into your program. I'm not sure what files are "modified" when you run yarn, but I know that you are making the majority of the modifications to "src" folder and adding components to that folder, so if I had to make an educated guess, it would be that it modified the "src." 

  Researched answer:
Ok so this was a trick question. "yarn" is a javascript packaging manager that makes up a react app, so when you run yarn you open up a browser address called "local host 3000" and you're hosting your own react website/app. 


6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer:
  No idea, but my interest is piqued.

  Researched answer:
  Across the web, the answer is comming back as a function without a name. You can make a function without a name, but it usually can't be accessed once you've made it unless you use the keyword function. 


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering:
Conditional rendering is where depending on your "State" you can render just some of the behaviors of your application instead of the entire DOM. 

2. Props:
Props is an object that can be passed into any component, and it stands for "properties"

3. JavaScript Events:
Javascript events are javascripts interatctions with Html. ie: page refreshing, button clicking, and resizing windows/

4. Object oriented programming:
Object oriented programming is what learn focuses more on. It focuses on real world attributes instead of just databased coding. 

5. Ruby:
Ruby is yet another opensource programming language, it can be run through the terminal, It has helpful built in methods and is easy to read and write.
